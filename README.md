# Natours
Natours website created from a Udemy course on Advanced CSS and SASS taught by [@jonasschmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann). 

This project focuses on implementing modern CSS architecture including BEM methodology, 7-1 SASS architecture, and writing re-useable and maintainable code. The overall layout is based on fluid layouts and design is focused on desktop-first. This project also introduces responsive design elements such as media queries and art direction/resolution/density switching for images. Modern CSS design and properties are also used throughout the project.
